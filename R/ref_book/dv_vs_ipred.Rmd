# Purpose of this plot
The DV vs. IPRED plot is intended to ensure a proper coorelation between the obervations (DV) and the individual model predictions (IPRED). This plot is commonly used to verify the absence of trend in the IPRED.

# Interpetting this plot
 + Points should align on the unity line.    
 + Points below the unity line indicate over prediction (DV < IPRED) of the model while points above the unity line indicate under prediction of the model (DV > IPRED).   
 + They should be no apparent trend in the data (ie. check the look of the smooth curve).   
 + Search for single outlier point (an observation distant from the unity line) or outlier individual (several observations distan from the unity line and connected together by a line).   

# Creating this plot
```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4, fig.align='center'}
library(ggxpose)
xpose_data(dir = '../../inst/models/', runno = '037') %>%
  dv_vs_ipred()
```
